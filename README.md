Steps to get Push Notifications with AWS Pinpoint Campaigns

1. Create new project

2. Pod dependencies. `pod init`, add AWSPinpoint pod, and install via `pod install`
```
AWS_SDK_VERSION = "2.12.6"
target 'PinpointPushNotifications' do
  use_frameworks! 
  pod "AWSPinpoint", "~> #{AWS_SDK_VERSION}"
end
```
2. `open <Project>.xcworkspace`. If using the sample app: `open PinpointPushNotifications.xcworkspace`

3. Under the target, select "Signing & Capabilities", update the bundle identifer to something unique and select your Apple Developer account for the Team.

4. In the app, it will already have Push Notifications added. On a new app, click `+ Capability` and add Push Notification. You can check it out in your Apple Developer 
    - Now tap the Capabilities tab and set the Background Modes switch On. Then check the Remote notifications option:

5. If everything is set up correctly, you should see your Identifer at the (Apple Developer Program)[https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list] under Identifers.

6. `amplify init`

7. `amplify add analytics`
